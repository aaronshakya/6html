        <h1><u>Web Design</u></h1>
        <p> Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

        <h4> Elements of web design</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt> Layout </dt>
            <dd> The layout of the website is how the material is displayed on a page. Choosing the layout is an essential task for the designer. It should be simple, intuitive and accessible. Web designers can use blank areas called white spaces to organize the elements of the site with grid-based designs to keep them in order.</dd>


            <dt> Images </dt>
            <dd> Images are illustrations, graphics, photographs, icons and others used to provide supplementary information to the text. To create the effect desired, designers can pick images that complement each other and the brand that the website represents.</dd>


            <dt> Visual Hierachy</dt>
            <dd> Visual hierarchy is the order in which the user will process the information on the site. The designer creates it by applying a visual pattern to the website. The visual pattern is the way the design directs visitors' eyes and behaviors.
            For example, F-Patterns or Z-Patterns emphasize the top horizontal section of your site, where most designers place navigation and the brand's logo and sometimes a search box. These are elements that inspire user interaction and brand recognition.</dd>

            <summary> Ethical Hacking </summary>
            Ethical hacking is an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data using the strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps identify security vulnerabilities that can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.
